These are all the custom addons for IMSAR's OpenERP implementation.
This directory should be added to the openerp-server.conf file
in the "addons-path" directive.

Install this version of Odoo on your dev machine to match production:
http://nightly.odoo.com/8.0/nightly/rpm/odoo_8.0.20150515.noarch.rpm
Or find a commit from around the same time period, 2015-05-15, in the github repo.


*** IN PRODUCTION ***
The web server (this code) lives on the "eowyn" server, the database is the "minerva" server.
Both are running CentOS 7.

Don't update the Odoo code itself (meaning don't upgrade the RPM) because there are a couple of custom tweaks
to the Odoo source. Updating will wipe those out.

To refresh a module (for example, timekeeping) run the following as the odoo user, from the odoo dir:
openerp-server -d imsar_prod -u imsar_timekeeping -c /etc/odoo/odoo-server-single.conf --stop-after-init

To restart Odoo itself (which you'll need to do if you make any changes that affect the models), run as root:
systemctl restart odoo-server
Note that there's ALSO a service called "odoo", which is the one installed by the RPM. Don't use this one,
don't start this one. The custom "odoo-server" service has the correct configuration.
